# iOS 11 Image Upload bug

The bug uploading images on certain new devices running iOS 11 have been fixed, but only on stable 1.9.1, NOT testflight 1.9.1.

(Images upload as `unknown`)

If you have TestFlight, you must download the latest version from the **App Store.**

This affects the following devices:
* iPhone 7
* iPhone 7 Plus
* iPhone 8
* iPhone 8 Plus
* iPad Pro 10.5 inch
* iPad Pro 12.9 inch (2017)
