# Finding your Version and Build
When reporting bugs, or responding to bugs, it's crucial to include information about your Discord. Currently, you're only *required* to include your Version Number (0.0.154 or 4.1.6 etc), however it's *advised* to include your Build Number (4331 etc) in your report to help both Bug Hunters and Staff resolve your issue.

## Desktop Client - Version Number
For Windows, enter `%appdata%/discord<version>` in the directory bar of a File Explorer window.

Build Version | Folder location
------------ | -------------
Stable Build | `%appdata%/discord`
Public Test Build | `%appdata%/discordptb`
Canary Build | `%appdata%/discordcanary`

## macOS - Version Number
For macOS, just click the `Discord <Version>` menu on the menu bar, then click the `About Discord` module:
