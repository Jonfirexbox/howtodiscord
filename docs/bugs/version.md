# Finding your Version and Build

## Desktop
For reporting bugs on Desktop, to find the version of Discord, go to `%appdata%/discord<version>` for Windows, or `~/Library/Application Support/discord<version>` for macOS, and see what the numbered folder says.

For the Public Test Build, go to `%appdata%/discordptb` or `~/Library/Application Support/discordptb`
For Canary Build, go to `%appdata%/discordcanary` or `~/Library/Application Support/discordcanary`
For Stable Build, go to `%appdata%/discord` or `~/Library/Application Support/discord`

## Mobile
For Mobile, open Discord Settings and scroll all the way down on the screen that opens. It will say a number at the bottom - that is the version number.
