# Finding your Version and Build

## Desktop
### Version
Note that the Web versions don't have a version number, they just have a build number, which has instructions below.
#### Windows
For Windows, to find the version of Discord, go to `%appdata%/discord<version>`.

For the Public Test Build, go to `%appdata%/discordptb` or `~/Library/Application Support/discordptb`
For Canary, go to `%appdata%/discordcanary` or `~/Library/Application Support/discordcanary`
For Stable, go to `%appdata%/discord` or `~/Library/Application Support/discord`

#### macOS
For macOS, just click `Discord` at the top bar, then click `About Discord`.

#### Linux
For Linux, just open a terminal while Discord is running, and type the package name.

For Stable, `discord`
For PTB, `discord-ptb`⚠️
For Canary, `discord-canary`

### Build
To find the Build of discord, follow these steps:
(Note that as of now, this only works on Canary.)
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Command+Shift+I` on macOS)
2. click Console
3. Scroll up to the top.
4. The third message should say:
![Console Build Info](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/252296452708106240/356153419561435147/Screen_Shot_2017-09-09_at_12.06.19_PM.png)

If you want to find the version and build easily, or you are on a release channel other than Canary, you can run [this](https://gist.github.com/advaith1/b581ca3193f1f130c6405b56714f1828) in the console. ⚠️ **Warning**: Exercise caution when pasting anything into the console. Read and remember the warning displayed in the console.
## Mobile
For Mobile, open User Settings in Discord and scroll all the way down on the screen that opens. At the bottom, it will say the version number, followed by the build number in parentheses.
