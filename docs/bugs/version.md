# Finding your Version and Build
The Discord Web Apps do not have an assigned version number, however they do have a build number which has instructions below to retrieve.

## Windows
To find the version of Discord, enter `%appdata%/discord<version>` in the directory location of a File Explorer window.

For the Public Test Build, go to `%appdata%/discordptb`.  
For Canary, go to `%appdata%/discordcanary`.  
For Stable, go to `%appdata%/discord`.  

## macOS
For macOS, just click the `Discord <Version>` menu on the menu bar, then click the `About Discord` module:

## Linux
Open a terminal while Discord is running, and type the package name.

For Stable, `discord`.  
For PTB, `discord-ptb`.  
For Canary, `discord-canary`.  

## Mobile
For Mobile, open User Settings in Discord and scroll all the way down on the screen that opens. At the bottom, it will say the version number, followed by the build number in parentheses.

#### Retrieving the Build Number
You aren't required by any means to include the Build Number in bug reports, however you may need it for complicated reports. A Bug Hunter or an Employee will let you know if you need to include it.

To find the Build of Discord Canary, follow these steps:  
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Command+Shift+I` on macOS)
2. Click Console
3. Scroll up to the top.
4. The third message should say:
