# Reporting Discord Bugs
As with all software, Discord can sometimes have some :bugs: in it. Sometimes you may feel the urge to scream at someone about such :bugs:. Thankfully, we've got a solution that won't render you unable to speak for 3 days!  
Introducing: **Discord Testers** - The next in high-quality bug reporting.

## How it works
When you join Discord Testers (discord.gg/discord-testers), you'll find yourself in the #faqs channel. Now, before you go any further... **please read this goodness**. As a Bug Hunter, you spend 80% of your time answering questions that are covered in #faqs because people don't read. Not only will you save yourself time, but you'll reassure the remaining sanity of our Bug Hunters.

Once you've read #faqs, you'll want to read #bot-help. Or, skim through it if you're in a rush. Dabbit Prime created a really good tool for reporting bugs without having to remember the syntax. Check it out [here](https://dabbit.typeform.com/to/mnlaDU).

Once you've submitted your bug in the relevant channel (make sure that it's in the right channel), us Bug Hunters will see it show up in #bug-approval-queue. From there, we'll attempt to reproduce the bug. If the bug can be reproduced and it is actually a bug, hasn't already been reported and the report is specific enough, we'll approve it. Three approvals and it's through to the Bug Tracker (i.e. the Trello boards). Be warned though - if three Bug Hunters deny your report, it'll be rejected. Feel free to ask about rejected bugs though; We're happy to explain.

## Bug Hunters
Bug Hunters are an elite group of community volunteers who tirelessly assist Discord Staff with managing bugs. We've got additional permissions that help us keep track of bugs, and generally, we can help if you have any issue with Discord or the reporting process. We're friendly people, so please don't be afraid to say hi :)

## Do's and Don'ts
Lots of stuff happens in Disscord Testers, so here's a list of do's and don'ts:

Do | Don't
---------- | ----------
Be kind to everyone | Harass Staff or Bug Hunters
Ask questions | Be ignorant
Listen and take on feedback | Randomly tag staff
Read the pins in #general | Think that you have no say

Just generally, don't be a dick and you'll be golden.
