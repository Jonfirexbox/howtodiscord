# Unsupported Environments

Although Discord is developed for everyone, it's not possible to support every environment, hence, why some environments aren't supported. Such bug reports should be denied with reason. Although some bugs are because of an unsupported environment, bugs that also occur on supported environments are to be approved.

## Unsupported Enviroments
- Any client modifications (BeautifulDiscord, betterDiscord, etc.)
- Safari, Internet Explorer, or Edge browsers
- Any pre-Windows 7 versions
- Mobile Website
- Rooted Android devices, jailbroken iOS devices
- Any iPhone 4s' and below
- Android 4.1 and below
- Any bug involving text going out of modals because of a long translation
- Using multiple instances of Discord concurrently
- Any bug involving resizing the window to a size smaller than is normally allowed
- Any bug that occurs only on virtual machines (if they can be reproduced on actual hardware, it's valid)
- Amazon Fire Tablets
- macOS versions lower than 10.10
- Any pre-release/beta/etc version of any OS (Example: iOS 11 Beta). However, P1 and P0 (crashes and major bugs) can be reported even if they only occur on beta OSes.
