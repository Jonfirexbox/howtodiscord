Complaints/Questions about any official servers should be forwarded to [Discord Support](mailto:support@discordapp.com).

## A public list of all public official Discord Guilds/Servers
Not all Official Servers/Guilds are included in this list - HypeSquad, Partners and Discord Staff are examples. You need to be in the relevant programs/positions for invites to these servers.

### Notable Servers
Several staff have opened their own servers, and the community hosts a range of other servers.  
A lot of these Servers/Guilds aren't advertised publicly, so I may be missing quite a few servers. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ItsPugle/DiscordApp/issues/new) if you've got other servers that the owner has approved to being public (make sure to mention @ItsPugle).
