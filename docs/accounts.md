# Discord Accounts
[< Return to the home](/index)

To start using Discord you'll need a Discord account. Funny how they works. Discord accounts are the accounts used by users to send and receive messages, upload files to Discords CDN, or participate in servers or calls.

## Getting an acccount
Before you start using, you need to make a Discord account, which you can get on the official Discord site here:
[Official Discord Site](https://www.discordapp.com). To get a wonderful account, go to the login button in the top of the
screen as shown here:

After you go to that screen, click on the register button, that's a little bit hidden there.

After that, fill in the required information, and then BOOM! Your Discord account is ready to go! Go on and chat with friends
without limits! There you go!

## Deleting your account
If you're running the Canary client, you are able to delete your account by pressing the 'Delete Account' button in the User Settings menu. Otherwise, you'll need to [send an email to Discord Support](mailto:support@discordapp.com?subject=Account%20Deletion%20Request)
