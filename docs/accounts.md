# Introduction
To start using **Discord** you need a *Discord* account, like in any other platform, you could get a account on the official
Discord site, I guess your here to check some stuff out or you have a serious problem, whatever it is, don't worry, I got
your back!

# Getting an acccount
Before you start using, you need to make a Discord account, which you can get on the official Discord site here: 
[Official Discord Site](https://www.discordapp.com). To get a wonderful account, go to the login button in the top of the 
screen as shown here:
