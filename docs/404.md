# Oops - I think I broke it!
Looks like rather you did something wrong, or I need to reconsider if I should still work in programming.  
Whilst I doubt myself, why don't you [report an issue](https://github.com/ItsPugle/DiscordApp/issues/new) if you think I've broken something, or [head back home](/index) if you're lost.

Sorry for the pain!  
Have a cute gif of me trying to fix this:
